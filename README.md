Roll your own BGP application with Rotonda. 

BGP services that you will be able to build with Rotonda include, but are not
limited to, a route monitor, a route collector, a route server, or a route reflector.

Rotonda is and always
will be free, open-source software.

>### ROTONDA IS CURRENTLY IN ALPHA, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

> Rotonda is being actively worked on and this repository and all the packages
> we supply are still in ALPHA stage. Use it to experiment freely (we value your
> feedback!), but do not use it with data and data-streams you cannot afford
> to lose.
>
> You should also be aware that all the APIs, configuration and the `roto`
> syntax and grammar are still (highly) unstable.

### ROADMAP

Rotonda is under heavy development and should be considered **alpha** software. See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) in this repository for more details.

The documentation does not necessarily reflect the reality of Rotonda at this stage. Features that appear in the documentation might only be partly implemented â€” or not at all. Likewise, implemented features may be undocumented. Before we make an official release we will clearly mark the status of all features in the documentation.
