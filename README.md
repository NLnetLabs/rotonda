# Rotonda

<img align="right" src="doc/manual/source/resources/rotonda-illustrative-icon.png" height="150">

Roll your own BGP application with Rotonda. 

BGP services that you will be able to build with Rotonda include, but are not
limited to, a route monitor, a route collector, a route server, or a route reflector.

Rotonda is and always
will be free, open-source software.

### INSTALLATION

There is no packaged, versioned release of `Rotonda` yet. You can install from
the main branch if you have a Rust toolchain installed.

First, you'll need some general build tools, to be able to download and
install `Rust`. On the command line issue this command, while making sure you
have enough privileges on the system to perform these actions:

```bash
apt install curl build-essential gcc make
```

This is for Debian based systems, on other distributions and/or operating
systems you will have to install these tools as well.

On most based systems you can then install `Rust` by issuing:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

and then finally you can build Rotonda directly from github:

```bash
cargo install rotonda --git https://github.com/NLnetLabs/rotonda
```

If you restart your shell, you can start Rotonda by simply typing:

```bash
rotonda
```

Note that rotonda will probably tell you it can't find its filters. Read the
documentation for more information about this. Also not that rotonda needs a
`Rust` version `1.71` or higher, which means that if you are using a Rust version
packaged by your distribution, that Rust version may be outdated.

Releases on `crates.io`, the online `Rust` library collection, and a proper
versioned release with `.deb` and `.rpm` packages is under way. If the above
installation method does not work for you, we advise you to wait for this
release.

### ROADMAP

`Rotonda` is under heavy development and should be considered **alpha**
software. See the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) in this repository for more details.

### DOCUMENTATION

The documentation does not necessarily reflect the reality of `Rotonda` at this
stage. Features that appear in the documentation might only be partly
implemented â€” or not at all. Likewise, implemented features may be
undocumented. Before we make an official release we will clearly mark the
status of all features in the documentation.
