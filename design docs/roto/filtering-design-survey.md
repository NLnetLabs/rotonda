## "Objects"

### Access List

Packet based.

`access-list <ACL_ID> <ACL_TYPE> <IP_ADDR>|any`

adds a rule to access-list with id `<ACL_ID>`.

ex.:

`access-list 1 deny 10.20.0.0`

`access-list 1 permit any`

Also, extended ACLs:

`access-list <ACL_ID> <ACL_TYPE> ip <PREFIX_NET> <SIGNIFICANT_BITS_MASK> <MIN_LENGTH_MASK> <ADDRESS_MASK>`

This terrible, even Cisco admits this. That's why they have prefix lists.

### Distribute List

Route based. A collection of access-lists plus a filter action (e.g., in or out).

`neighbor <IP_ADDR> distribute-list <ACL_ID> <FILTER_DIRECTION>`

ex.:

`neighbor 10.100.83.1 ditribute-list 1 out`

### Prefix List

Route based. the packet based approach needs a `access-list` to define the ACL and a `distribute-list` to tie it to a filter action.
`prefix-list` has no such requirement, there's only the `prefix-list` keyword.

To use a `prefix-list`:

`neighbor <IP_ADDR> prefix-list <PL_ID> <FILTER_DIRECTION>`

To define one:

`ip prefix-list <PL_ID> seq <SEQUENCE_NUMBER> <FILTER_ACTION> <IP_PREFIX>`

Note that `<PL_ID>` is a string, rather than an integer (as in the case of access|distribute-lists). A prefix can be extended with a `ge` or `le` modifier to indicate a sub|super range of the prefix.

## Filter Types / Actions

Next to the ACL-style filter-actions, `deny`, `permit` it can do filtering BGP attributes.

### AS_PATH

with regex (yes, uncontroversially terrible):

e.g.:

`ip as-path access-list 83 permit "1_701_(_5466_ | _1240_).*"`

### Route Map

a `route-map` ties a filter actions and filter types to routes. This is basically used for anything that's more than `deny`, `permit` and AS_PATH filtering.

e.g.:

```
route-map ASPEN deny 10
  match ip address prefix-list MILLER
  match local-preference 150
  match community WARREN
```

where `MILLER` and `WARREN` are defined elsewhere.

You can also change attributes of a route with a `route-map`:

e.g.:

```
route-map ASPEN deny permit 20
  match ip address prefix-list MILLER
    match local-preference 150
    match community WARREN
    set local-preference 100
    set comm-list WARREN delete
```

furthermore, route-maps are also used to determine which (transitive) attributes get sent to which peer, e.g. `send-community`.

### Peer Group

group a bunch of neighbors into a single entity and specify policies for them.

### Peer Template

Successor to the Peer Group. Also, you can't use both on a neighbor. Offers (explicit) inheritance, with an inheritance sequence number.
There's session templates and peer templates. No variables.

### Policy Template

## Differences between FRR and Cisco

FRR generally follows the Cisco CLI, it has sanitized it a bit though. FRR consequently has access-lists and prefix-lists, but no distribute-list, it uses the prefix-list syntax for both, including having the `seq` keyword on both access-lists and prefix-lists.

FRR does not offer peer templates, only peer groups.

FRR offers an embedded Lua interpreter, that can hook into a callback that gets invoked at the end of each data-plane event. This is a passive (listening) feature only.

# Bird

Bird offers a small procedural DSL to create filters. Variables and functions can be created. Next to that it has an object called, well, filters. The DSL has control structures, well it only has `if-then-else`, and it can't do loops.

A filter is a named object that receives the attributes of a route (implicitly). This filter can then use read some of these values and mutate of them. I assume then most, if not all, of the BGP attributes are available, but I can't find it in the docs.

Another nice feature is that the DSL uses data types for the attributes, e.g. a `bgp_path` value that's passed into the filter is of type `bgppath`,e.g. `(path 4 3 2 1)`. It has then its own methods, .e.g `.first`, etc.

The Bird filter DSL is rather terse (in true C-style), e.g. the Cisco-style notation `10.2.0.0/24 le 26 ge 30` would be `10.2.0.0/24{26, 30}` in Bird. In Juniper-style this would be `10.2.0.0/24 prefix-length-range /26-/30`.

# Junos (Juniper)

Junos calls all of its filtering capabilities: `policy framework`. It's declarative.

All policies are composed of the following components that you configure:

- Match conditions—Criteria against which a route or packets are compared. You can configure one or more criteria. If all criteria match, one or more actions are applied. The match conditions are:

  - Autonomous system (AS) path expression—A combination of AS numbers and regular expression operators.

  - Community—A group of destinations that share a common property.

  - Prefix list—A named list of prefixes.

  - Route list—A list of destination prefixes.

  - Subroutine—A routing policy that is called repeatedly from other routing policies.

- Actions—What happens if all criteria match. You can configure one or more actions. Basically you can use _accept_ and _reject_ here, or a control-flow actions, e.g. _next term_.

- Terms—Named structures in which match conditions and actions are defined. You can define one or more terms.

In this policy framework there's a strong distinction between _import_ and _export_ policies.

Prefix lists are comparable with the Cisco `prefix-list`, but its syntax is way more powerful, it lets you define ranges of more-specifics in various ways, i.e. with `orLonger`, `range`.

A _subroutine_ is a policy that can be called repeatedly from other policies. A policy can also be called from another policy, but only in a chained fashion, a so-called _policy chain_.

Junos has no data-types, like Cisco. Matching on most attributes happens through regular expressions on strings.

Junos configuration is more verbose than any of the other implementations discussed here. Also, Junos configurations are less single-line CLI oriented than Cisco's. OTOH they can be declared in single-lines in the CLI.

```
policy-options {
    policy-statement gendefault {
        term upstreamroutes {
            from {
                protocol bgp;
                as-path upstream;
                route-filter 0.0.0.0/0 upto /16;
            }
            then {
                next-hop 10.0.45.1;
                accept;
            }
        }
        term end {
            then reject;
        }
    }
    as-path upstream "^64500 ";
}
```

# Discussion

The Cisco/FRR cli is the arch-version of a router CLI, and it that's both a blessing and a curse. The blessing is the familiarity people have with it, and the curse is all the cruft that has been piled on it. To my taste it's also basically too terse and therefore too cryptic for people not used to it. Also, probably people are more used to the older and maybe deprecated features, instead of the newer ones. The templating system is too rigid and too clunky.

The Juniper has a more modern feel to it, and is certainly more descriptive (I like the prefix list definitions). It feels more structured than Cisco's.

Bird's filter DSL is pretty flexible and powerful, but also a bit too terse to my taste. For simple filters it's probably quite a hurdle to overcome. Having actual data types is great, I think, both in terms of performance, readability and safety.
