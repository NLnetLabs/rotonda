Roll your own BGP service with Rotonda. 

BGP services that you can build with Rotonda include, but are not
limited to, a route monitor|collector|server|reflector, all this without
modifying a single line in the source code of Rotonda. Rotonda is and always
will be free, open-source software.

### Modular

Rotonda applications are built by combining units into a pipeline through
which BGP data will flow. You can filter, modify and store the BGP data along
the way, and create signals based on it to send to other applications. Units
can be added and removed in a *running* Rotonda application.

Rotonda offers units to create BGP and BMP sessions, filters, Routing
Information Bases (RIBs), and more.

### Flexible

The behavior of the units can be modeled by using a small, fun programming
language called `Roto`, that we created to combine flexibility and
ease-of-use. `Roto` lets you configure a Rotonda application, program units
and create queries. `Roto` scripts can be created with your favorite text
editor, but they can also be composed from the command line that's included
in Rotonda.

### High Performance

All data structures come with a trade-off between space and time, and Rotonda
is no exception. Rotonda therefore offers units that perform the same task,
but with different performance characteristics, so that you can optimize
for your needs, be it a high-volume, low latency installation or a small
installation in a constraint environment. None of this requires patching the
Rotonda source, it's all configurable with a nimble `Roto` script.

Although Rotonda is still in alpha, these performance-critical parts have 
been battle-tested by, and are indeed being used in, large production
environments.

### Observable

All Rotonda units have their own finely-grained logging capabilities, and
some have built-in queryable JSON API interfaces to give information about
their current state and content through Rotonda's built-in HTTPS server.
Signals can be sent to other applications. Moreover, Rotonda offers true
observability by allowing the user to trace BMP/BGP packets start-to-end
through the whole pipeline.

### Storage Persistence

By default a Rotonda application stores all the data that you want to collect
in memory. It can be configured to persist parts to another
storage location, such as files or a database. Whether you put RIBs to
files or in a database, you can still query it transparently with `Roto`.

### Distributed

Multiple Rotonda instances can synchronize or shard data via our AVRO-based
`rotoro` protocol, to create robust redundancy and/or scalability. Again you
can still query all the distributed instances with `Roto`.
