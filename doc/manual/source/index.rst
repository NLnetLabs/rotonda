Rotonda |version|
=================

Rotonda consists of a set of types of components that can be mixed and
matched to build a BGP routing service. You can build one big stand-alone
application, or you can build a set of distributed runtimes that are
communicating through the rotoro ("Rotonda to Rotonda") protocol.
