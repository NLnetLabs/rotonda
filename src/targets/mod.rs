//! The targets for RPKI data.
//!
//! A target is anything that produces the final output from payload data.
//! Each target is connected to exactly one unit and constantly converts its
//! payload set into some form of output.
//!
//! This module contains all the different kinds of targets currently
//! available. It provides access to them via the enum [`Target`] that
//! contains all types as variants.
//!
//! Targets can be created from configuration via serde deserialization. They
//! are started by spawning them into an async runtime and then just keep
//! running there.

//------------ Sub-modules ---------------------------------------------------
//
// These contain all the actual unit types grouped by shared functionality.
